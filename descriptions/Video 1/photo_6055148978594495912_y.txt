The video transitions to urban winter scenes viewed from a train. A bustling cityscape with colorful advertisements and snow-covered streets can be seen. The focus then shifts to a serene view of the ocean through the train window, capturing the contrast between the busy city and the calm sea. The woman, now wearing a cozy grey coat and blue scarf, gazes out of the window, enjoying the peaceful scenery.
